### Key Features

The term “Lean PHP” typically refers to how lean principles can be applied to the PHP programming language in software development. Lean is centered around reducing waste and maximizing value, which can be implemented in software development in various ways. Lean principles generally include the following concepts:

- **Agile Compatibility**: Supports continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices.
- **Lean Startup Ready**: "Download, run, and develop" model for frequent product releases.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimizes total cost of ownership, no expensive licenses required.
- **Rapid Development and Deployment**: Simplifies setup and speeds up development processes.
- **Creating Value**: Focusing on features that create real value for customers.
- **Improving Process Flow**: Removing barriers between processes to make workflow continuous.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reviewing and improving processes.
- **Reducing Waste**: Minimizing waste of time, resources, and effort.
- **Rapid Feedback**: Quickly obtaining feedback from customers and users and reflecting it on the product.
- **Quick Setup and Usage**: LeanPHP stands out with its fast and simple setup process, allowing developers to start building immediately.
- **Integrated Core Features**: Includes error handling, logging, email sending, unit testing, and JWT token-based authentication and authorization.
- **Minimalist Architecture**: Designed to be lightweight and efficient, running on any PHP hosting environment without additional setup.
- **RESTful Backend**: Provides robust RESTful API support, making it easy to create APIs.
- **User Management**: Ready-to-use user management features such as login, register, forgot password, and profile management.
- **Corporate Support**: Offers professional support to help businesses implement and maintain their applications.
